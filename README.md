## ACL module for Kohana v3.0.6+.

Working with Auth for now and support only Jelly. In future it will support more orms and in theory can be used with different auth libraries (A1 for instance).

To work with your favorite orm library, make a copy of the models from classes/_models/<your_orm>/* to your application/classes/model/ folder and feel free to modify them to your needs.
